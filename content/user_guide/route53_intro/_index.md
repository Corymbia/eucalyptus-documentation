# Using Route53
Eucalyptus Route53 is an integrated Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Route53 allows end users to access your cloud resources using names that you control.

Route53 seamlessly connects user requests to Eucalyptus controlled infrastructure – including EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, and S3 buckets – it can also be used to route users to external infrastructure.
