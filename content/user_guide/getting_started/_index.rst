Getting Started
===============

This section helps you get started using your Eucalyptus cloud, and covers setting up your user credentials, installing and configuring the command line tools, and working with images and instances.As a cloud user, you can access the Eucalyptus cloud using a command line interface such as Euca2ools, or using a web-based interface such as the Eucalyptus Management Console. You can switch between them freely. What you create in one will be accessible through the other. 

To access Eucalyptus via the command line tools, you need keys for Euca2ools. To access Eucalyptus with the Management Console, you'll need a password for the Management Console. Talk to your cloud administrator to get your keys and passwords.
