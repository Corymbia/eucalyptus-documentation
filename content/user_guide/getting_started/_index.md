# Getting Started
This section helps you get started using your Eucalyptus cloud, and covers setting up your user credentials, installing and configuring command line tools, and working with images and instances. As a cloud user, you can access the Eucalyptus cloud using a command line interface such as the AWS CLI, or by using a web-based interface such as the Eucalyptus Management Console.

To access Eucalyptus via the command line, you can use the AWS CLI or Euca2ools with access key credentials. To access Eucalyptus with the Management Console, you'll need a password. Talk to your cloud administrator to get your keys and passwords.
