# Using Elastic Load Balancing
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming traffic across your Eucalyptus cloud. It enables you to achieve even greater fault tolerance by automatically detecting instances that are overloaded, and rerouting traffic to other instances as needed.Elastic Load Balancing works in conjunction with Eucalyptus's Auto Scaling and Cloud Watch services, to make your cloud more robust and efficient. 

The following section describes how load balancing works, provides an overview of load balancing concepts, and includes a series of usage scenarios that will show you how to perform common load balancing tasks.
