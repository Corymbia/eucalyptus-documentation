# Using CloudWatch
CloudWatch is a Eucalyptus service that enables you to monitor, manage, and publish various metrics, as well as configure alarm actions based on data from metrics. You can use the default metrics that come with Eucalyptus, or you can use your own metrics.CloudWatch collects raw data from your cloud's resources and generates the information into readable, near real-time metrics. These metrics are recorded for a period of two weeks. This allows you to access historical information and provides you with information about how your resource is performing.
