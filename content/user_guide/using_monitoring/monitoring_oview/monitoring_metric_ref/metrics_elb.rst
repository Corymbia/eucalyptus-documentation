This section discusses the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) metrics and dimensions available to CloudWatch. 



=========================
Available Metrics for ELB
=========================



.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  *
    - Metric
    - Description
    - Unit
  *
    - Latency
    - Time elapsed after the request leaves the load balancer until it receives the corresponding response. Valid Statistics: Minimum | Maximum | Average | Count
    - Seconds
  *
    - RequestCount
    - The number of requests handled by the load balancer.
    - Count
  *
    - HealthyHostCount
    - The number of healthy instances registered with the load balancer in a specified availability zone. Healthy instances are those that have not failed more health checks than the value of the unhealthy threshold. Constraints: You must provide both LoadBalancerName and AvailabilityZone dimensions for this metric.Valid Statistics: Minimum | Maximum | Average
    - Count
  *
    - UnHealthyHostCount
    - The number of unhealthy instances registered with the load balancer. These are instances that have failed more health checks than the value of the unhealthy threshold. Constraints: You must provide both LoadBalancerName and AvailabilityZone dimensions for this metric.Valid Statistics: Minimum | Maximum | Average
    - Count
  *
    - HTTPCode_ELB_4XX
    - Count of HTTP response codes generated by ELB that are in the 4xx (client error) series. Valid Statistics: Sum
    - Count
  *
    - HTTPCode_ELB_5XX
    - Count of HTTP response codes generated by ELB that are in the 5xx (server error) series. ELB can generate 5xx errors if no back-end instances are registered, no healthy back-end instances, or the request rate exceeds ELB's current available capacity. This response count does not include any responses that were generated by back-end instances. Valid Statistics: Sum
    - Count
  *
    - HTTPCode_Backend_2XX
    - Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 2xx (success) series. Valid Statistics: Sum
    - Count
  *
    - HTTPCode_Backend_3XX
    - Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 3xx (user action required) series. Valid Statistics: Sum
    - Count
  *
    - HTTPCode_Backend_4XX
    - Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 4xx (client error) series. This response count does not include any responses that were generated by ELB. Valid Statistics: Sum
    - Count
  *
    - HTTPCode_Backend_5XX
    - Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 5xx (server error) series. This response count does not include any responses that were generated by ELB. Valid Statistics: Sum
    - Count




============================
Available Dimensions for ELB
============================

You can use the currently available dimensions for ELB to refine the metrics returned by a query. For example, you could use ``HealthyHostCount`` and dimensions ``LoadBalancerName`` and ``AvailabilityZone`` to get the average number of healthy instances behind the specified load balancer within the specified Availability Zone for a given period of time. 

You can aggregate ELB data along any of the following dimensions shown in the following table. 



.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  *
    - Metric
    - Description
  *
    - LoadBalancerName
    - Limits the metric data to instances that are connected to the specified load balancer.
  *
    - AvailabilityZone
    - Limits the metric data to load balancers in the specified availability zone.
