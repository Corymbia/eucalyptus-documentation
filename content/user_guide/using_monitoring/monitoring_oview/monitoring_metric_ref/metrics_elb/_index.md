This section discusses the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) metrics and dimensions available to CloudWatch. 


## Available Metrics for ELB


| Metric | Description | Unit | 
|  :---- |  :---- |  :---- | 
| Latency | Time elapsed after the request leaves the load balancer until it receives the corresponding response. Valid Statistics: Minimum | Maximum | Average | Count | Seconds | 
| RequestCount | The number of requests handled by the load balancer. | Count | 
| HealthyHostCount | The number of healthy instances registered with the load balancer in a specified availability zone. Healthy instances are those that have not failed more health checks than the value of the unhealthy threshold. Constraints: You must provide both LoadBalancerName and AvailabilityZone dimensions for this metric.Valid Statistics: Minimum | Maximum | Average | Count | 
| UnHealthyHostCount | The number of unhealthy instances registered with the load balancer. These are instances that have failed more health checks than the value of the unhealthy threshold. Constraints: You must provide both LoadBalancerName and AvailabilityZone dimensions for this metric.Valid Statistics: Minimum | Maximum | Average | Count | 
| HTTPCode_ELB_4XX | Count of HTTP response codes generated by ELB that are in the 4xx (client error) series. Valid Statistics: Sum | Count | 
| HTTPCode_ELB_5XX | Count of HTTP response codes generated by ELB that are in the 5xx (server error) series. ELB can generate 5xx errors if no back-end instances are registered, no healthy back-end instances, or the request rate exceeds ELB's current available capacity. This response count does not include any responses that were generated by back-end instances. Valid Statistics: Sum | Count | 
| HTTPCode_Backend_2XX | Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 2xx (success) series. Valid Statistics: Sum | Count | 
| HTTPCode_Backend_3XX | Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 3xx (user action required) series. Valid Statistics: Sum | Count | 
| HTTPCode_Backend_4XX | Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 4xx (client error) series. This response count does not include any responses that were generated by ELB. Valid Statistics: Sum | Count | 
| HTTPCode_Backend_5XX | Count of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances that are in the 5xx (server error) series. This response count does not include any responses that were generated by ELB. Valid Statistics: Sum | Count | 


## Available Dimensions for ELB
You can use the currently available dimensions for ELB to refine the metrics returned by a query. For example, you could use `HealthyHostCount` and dimensions `LoadBalancerName` and `AvailabilityZone` to get the average number of healthy instances behind the specified load balancer within the specified Availability Zone for a given period of time. 

You can aggregate ELB data along any of the following dimensions shown in the following table. 



| Metric | Description | 
|  :---- |  :---- | 
| LoadBalancerName | Limits the metric data to instances that are connected to the specified load balancer. | 
| AvailabilityZone | Limits the metric data to load balancers in the specified availability zone. |
