..  _concept_rpk_dtq_kt:

The Domain Name System (DNS) is an Internet standard that maps unique DNS names (for example: www.example.com) to the underlying public IP address (for example: 128.0.0.1). 

Eucalyptus provides a DNS service with your cloud. By default, EC2 classic (EDGE mode) and VPCMIDO mode default subnet instances that are launched in your Eucalyptus cloud are automatically assigned public and private DNS names from the Eucalyptus DNS service.
