# Using Virtual Private Cloud
Eucalyptus Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an implementation of Amazon VPC that allows you to define a logically isolated virtual network that can contain Eucalyptus resources. A virtual network enhances security by allowing you to have fine-grained, explicit control over network gateways, subnets, IP address ranges, and inbound and outbound connectivity. This section of the User Guide covers how Eucalyptus VPC works and how to use it.
