## How VPC Works
Eucalyptus Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an implementation of Amazon VPC that allows you to run instances inside an isolated virtual network that you define. Eucalyptus VPC enables you to have control over subnets, internet gateways, and IP address ranges and allocations inside of this virtual network, as well as the ability to define and use multiple layers of security with security groups.
