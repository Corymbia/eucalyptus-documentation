# Managing Access
Eucalyptus manages access to the cloud by policies attached to accounts, groups, and users. This section details access-related tasks you can perform once your administrator allows you access to Eucalyptus. These tasks are split into the following areas: tasks for groups, and tasks for users, and tasks for credential management.
