It is also possible to launch ephemeral Windows instances. Just like their Linux counterparts, modifications to Windows instance store-backed instances are lost when instances are purposely or accidentally terminated. 

Ephemeral space in a Windows instance store-backed instance is presented as formatted drive space accessible via a logical drive letter. The logical drive is sized so that the instance’s total storage size matches the vmtype’s storage size.
