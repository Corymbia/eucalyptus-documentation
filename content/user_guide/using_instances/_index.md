Every instance is created from stored . An image contains the basic operating system and often other software that will be needed when the instance is running. When you launch an instance, you tell the cloud what image to base the instance on. Your cloud administrator should have set up a catalog of standard or customized images for you to use.To find out more about what instances are, see [](understanding_instances.dita) .
