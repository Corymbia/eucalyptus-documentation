This topic describes how to register a Node Controller (NC) with a Cluster Controller (CC).**Prerequisites** 

* The Cluster Controller service must be properly installed and started. 
* The Node Controller service must be properly installed and started. 
* If you are upgrading, you should understand that: 
**To register the Node Controller service with the Eucalyptus cloud** SSH to the Cluster Controller in the zone. On the CC, register all NCs using the following command with the IP address of each NC host machine: 
    clusteradmin-register-nodes node0_IP_address ... [nodeN_IP_address]

For example: 


    clusteradmin-register-nodes 10.111.5.160 10.111.5.161 10.111.5.162

Copy the CC's security credentials using the following command: 
    clusteradmin-copy-keys node0_IP_address ... [nodeN_IP_address]

For example: 


    clusteradmin-copy-keys 10.111.5.160 10.111.5.161 10.111.5.162

Repeat the steps for each zone in your cloud. The registered Node Controller service is now ready for your cloud.
