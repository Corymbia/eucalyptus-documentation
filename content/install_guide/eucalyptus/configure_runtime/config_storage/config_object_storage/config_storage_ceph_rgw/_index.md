This topic describes how to configure Ceph Rados Gateway (RGW) as the backend for the Object Storage Gateway (OSG).**Prerequisites** 

* Successful completion of all the install sections prior to this section. 
* The UFS must be registered and enabled. 
* A Ceph storage cluster is available. 
* The ceph-radosgw service has been installed (on the UFS or any other host) and configured to use the Ceph storage cluster. recommends using civetweb with ceph-radosgw service. is a lightweight web server and is included in the ceph-radosgw installation. It is relatively easier to install and configure than the alternative option â€“ a combination of Apache and Fastcgi modules. 
* You must execute the steps below as a administrator. 
For more information on Ceph-RGW, see the [Ceph-RGW documentation](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/) .

**To configure Ceph-RGW object storage for the OSG** Configure `objectstorage.providerclient` to ceph-rgw: 
    euctl objectstorage.providerclient=ceph-rgw

Configure `objectstorage.s3provider.s3endpoint` to the ip:port of the host running the ceph-radosgw service:

Depending on the front end web server used by ceph-radosgw service, the default port is 80 for apache and 7480 for civetweb.

    euctl objectstorage.s3provider.s3endpoint=<radosgw-host-ip>:<radosgw-webserver-port>

Configure `objectstorage.s3provider.s3accesskey` and `objectstorage.s3provider.s3secretkey` with the radosgw user credentials: 
    euctl objectstorage.s3provider.s3accesskey=<radosgw-user-accesskey>


    euctl objectstorage.s3provider.s3secretkey=<radosgw-user-secretkey>

The Ceph-RGW backend and OSG are now ready for production.
