This section describes the parameters you need to set in order to launch Eucalyptus for the first time.

The first launch of Eucalyptus is different than a restart of a previously running Eucalyptus deployment in that it sets up the security mechanisms that will be used by the installation to ensure system integrity.

Eucalyptus configuration is stored in a text file, */etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.conf*, that contains key-value pairs specifying various configuration parameters.
