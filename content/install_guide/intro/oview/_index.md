Eucalyptus was designed to be easy to install and as non-intrusive as possible. The software framework is modular, with industry-standard, language-agnostic communication.Eucalyptus provides a virtual network overlay that both isolates network traffic of different users and allows two or more clusters to appear to belong to the same Local Area Network (LAN). Also, Eucalyptus offers API compatibility with Amazonâ€™s EC2, S3, IAM, ELB, Auto Scaling, CloudFormation, and CloudWatch services. This offers you the capability of a hybrid cloud.
