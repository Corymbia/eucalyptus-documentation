## Introduction to Eucalyptus
Eucalyptus is a Linux-based software architecture that implements scalable private and hybrid clouds within your existing IT infrastructure. Eucalyptus allows you to use your own collections of resources (hardware, storage, and network) using a self-service interface on an as-needed basis.You deploy a Eucalyptus cloud across your enterpriseâ€™s on-premise data center. Users access Eucalyptus over your enterprise's intranet. This allows sensitive data to remain secure from external intrusion behind the enterprise firewall. 

You can install Eucalyptus on the following Linux distributions: 



* CentOS 7 
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7
