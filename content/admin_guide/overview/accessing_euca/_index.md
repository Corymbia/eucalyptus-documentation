Eucalyptus supports two command line interfaces (CLIs): the administration CLI and the user CLI.The administration CLI is installed when you install Eucalyptus server-side components. The administration CLI is for maintaining and modifying Eucalyptus. 

The other user CLI, called Euca2ools, can be downloaded and installed on clients. Euca2ools is a set of commands for end users and can be used with both Eucalyptus and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
