This topic details best practices for managing your cloud policies.

* Establish a workflow for account creation, including the initial request for a cloud account and the email containing credentials. 
* Limit your use of individual policies. Focus your policies on groups and add individuals to the group. 
* Use groups to assign permissions to individual users. Limit the use of policies for individual users.
