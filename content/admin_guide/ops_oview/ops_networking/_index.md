This topic addresses networking in the Eucalyptus cloud.
## Networking Modes
Eucalyptus offers different modes to provide you with a cloud that will fit in your current network. For information what each networking mode has to offer, see [](../install-guide/planning_networking_modes.dita) . 


## EC2-Classic Networking
Eucalyptus EDGE networking mode supports EC2-Classic networking. Your instances run in a single, flat network that you share with others. For more information about EC2-Classic networking, see [EC2 Supported Platforms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html#platform-differences) . 


## EC2-VPC Networking
Eucalyptus VPCMIDO networking mode resembles the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) product wherein the network is fully configurable by users. For more information about EC2-VPC networking, see [Differences Between Instances in EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#differences-ec2-classic-vpc) .
