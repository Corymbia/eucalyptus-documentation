## Manage Users and Groups
You can also perform user authentication by integrating Eucalyptus with an existing LDAP or Active Directory. This information cannot be changed from Eucalyptus side when LDAP/AD integration is turned on. However, other Eucalyptus-specific information about user, group and account is still stored within the local database of Eucalyptus, including certificates, secret keys and attached policies.For more information about synchronizing an existing LDAP or Active Directory with Eucalyptus, see [](integrating_ldap.dita) .
