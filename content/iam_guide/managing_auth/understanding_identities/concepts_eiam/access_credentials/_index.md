This topic describes the different types of credentials used by Eucalyptus.Each user has a unique set of credentials. These credentials are used to authenticate access to resources. There are three types of credentials: 



* An is used to authenticate requests to the SOAP API service. 
* A is used to authenticate requests to the REST API service. 
You can manage credentials using the command line tools (the `euare-` commands). For more information about the command line tools, see the [Euca2ools Reference Guide](../euca2ools-guide/index.dita) . 

In IAM, each account has its own credentials. In Eucalyptus, the equivalent of account credentials are the credentials of admin user of the account.
