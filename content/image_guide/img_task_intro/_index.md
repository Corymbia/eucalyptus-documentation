# Image Tasks
An image is the basis for instances that you spin up for your computing needs. This section explains how to create or acquire an image and then add it to your Eucalyptus cloud. There are a few ways you can create or acquire an image for use in a Eucalyptus cloud: 

* Add an image based on an existing image. For more information, see https://www.eucalyptus.cloud/index.html#Images.
* Add an image that you create from scratch, by installing an operating system into a virtual machine.
* Migrate an image or an instance from another cloud, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or a virtualization platform.
