## Image Tasks
An image is the basis for instances that you spin up for your computing needs. This section explains how to create or acquire an image and then add it to your Eucalyptus cloud.There are a few ways you can create or acquire an image for use in a Eucalyptus cloud: 



* Add an image based on an existing image. Eucalyptus has stock images available to help you get started right away. For more information, see . 
* Add an image that you create from scratch, by installing an operating system into a virtual machine. This is the only way to deploy a Windows instance, since Eucalyptus Systems does not distribute such images. For more information, see the section. 
* Migrate an image or an instance from another cloud, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or a virtualization platform. For more information, see the section.
